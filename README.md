cryptocurrency_trading_simulator.py is used to simulate the cryptocurrency trading indicators.
Currently it support 'MACD','RSI','ARRON','SMA','EMA','WMA','BOLLINGER','CCI' indicators.
You need have CoinBase Pro API first, but if you have the other data soruce I think it also can support. If you have more data source please share it with me.
Because I'm not a expert of stock trading so I'm not familiar with these indicators. And you also can define your own trading condition and use this tool to simulate.
